- Clicking on Load More when in the mrtn language wont load martian translated stories, it will load english ones.
- Also switching from en to martian can crash the client request for more stories.

The Assignment

---------------------

At the following url (http://np-ec2-nytimes-com.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/test/nyregion2.js), you'll find a json file that gives you a list of stories, headlines, summaries and photos about New York. Your task is to use the server-side language and framework of your choice (bonus points for using Rails or Sinatra) to create a web page that does the following:

1. Fetches the contents of the nyregion2 json file and renders the list of stories in a simple list form with the information you think should display for each article. Extra points for making a beautiful, "Timesian" presentation of the list. Make sure its' responsive with a design to accommodate a web, tablet and phone breakpoint.


2.  Create the ability to toggle between English and a fake Martian language that follows these rules:

	> every word three characters or less is left alone

	> every word more than three characters is replaced with boinga.

	> Maintain the same capitalization and punctuation in the English and Martian versions.

3. Make sure the page responds with a status of 403 if it receives anything other than a GET request.

4. Create the ability to load older stories onto the page with a client side request for the following JSONP file (http://np-ec2-nytimes-com.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/test/nyregion.js).  When triggered, these stories should be appended to the list already rendered on the page.

5. When you're done, place all your code in a single folder, zip it up and send it back our way. Please don't minify any of the javascript or css you use in the app, and include any instructions weâ€™ll need to get it up and running.
